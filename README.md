### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Fell inlove with Golang and I just can't let go...

- ðŸ”­ Working on bug bounties, CTFs, backend systems and a few tools (will be added here in the future!)
- ðŸŒ± Nonstop learning. If I didn't discover something new or researched something for a day, it must mean I'm dead... 
- ðŸ‘¯ Collab on a self-hosted bug bounty API (golang) with a private discored channel and a toolset to allow remote work from mobile, desktop, pigeon carrier or any other platform.
- ðŸ’¬ AMA
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: omegapensec@protonmail.com
